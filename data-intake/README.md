# Data Intake
Data intake is the process of sending data files to Visier using APIs. After Visier receives the data files, runs different processes to make the data available to users to query and analyze. For more information about sending data to Visier, see [Data In](https://docs.visier.com/developer/Studio/data/data-in-home.htm).

## Samples
* [Direct Data Intake](ddi) provides code samples for the Direct Data Intake API. This API runs the data provisioning processes to make the data available.
* [Planning Data Load](planning-data-load) provides a sample script that uses planning-related APIs to load data into a plan and add rows that were not yet present in the plan.
