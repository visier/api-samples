    "# Extend the Visier Model\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "In this Jupyter notebook sample, learn how to use the Direct Data Intake (DDI) API in Extension mode to extend the data in a Visier object that is primarily loaded using other data transfer methods.\n",
    "This sample's purpose is to show how to call Visier's public APIs to query source data, combine source data with an external data set, and then send back the combined data to Visier.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this sample, we combine Employee data in Visier with the United States government Social Security Administration's (SSA) [publicly available name data](https://www.ssa.gov/oact/babynames/limits.html) to populate a new Employee property called Name_Rank.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Prerequisites\n",
    "Before running this sample, do the following:\n",
    "1. In your Visier tenant, create a simple number property with the object name `Name_Rank` on the `Employee` object in Visier. Publish the property to production.\n",
    "1. In your Visier tenant, create a profile and assign it to your API user with the following capabilities and additional capabilities:\n",
    "   1. Data: Write, API\n",
    "   1. Model: Read, API\n",
    "   1. Direct Publish\n",
    "   1. Legacy API Access\n",
    "   1. Manage Jobs\n",
    "   1. Upload Data\n",
    "1. Defined an `.env` file as described in the `.env.extension-table`\n",
    "1. Downloaded the [National Data file](https://www.ssa.gov/oact/babynames/names.zip) and extract file `yob2022.txt`.\n",
    "1. Copy `yob2022.txt` into a directory named `data`."
