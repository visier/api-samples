# Data Version Query History

The Data Version (DV) Query History sample application uses Visier APIs to fetch and analyze changes in your Visier tenant.

## Overview

Letâ€™s say we want to maintain a database that restates all changes every time an analytic object changes in Visier. We can use the Data Version Export APIs to retrieve the changes between two data versions in a Visier tenant, which allows us to identify objects that changed and the changes that occurred. However, the DV Export API doesn't retrieve changes to calculated fields, like calculated properties. To get the full change history of all attributes including calculated fields, we can use the Data Query APIs to retrieve specific attributes with their full history that weren't retrieved by the DV Export API. After we have all attributes using both APIs, we can then create a table that saves all received data in a database. 

The application performs the following operations:

1. **Load data version changes**: The application uses `DVExportApiClient` to run an export job to retrieve the delta (differences) between two data versions in the `DVManager` class. The application waits for the job to complete. After the job completes successfully, the application downloads a file containing the changes to a specific analytic object (new columns, deleted columns, updated columns).

2. **Select analytic object attributes**: The application selects attributes from the downloaded export file to include in a list query as a filter. 
The filter should be a dimension of the analytic object and should be set in the query file as a memberSet filter using the placeholder `${{DimensionName}}`. 
The application will replace this placeholder with the actual values from the data version export files.
E.g., the `employee.json` query file contains a filter for the `EmployeeID_Hierarchy` dimension with the placeholder `${{EmployeeID}}`: 
    ```json:
      "filters": [
        {
          "memberSet": {
            "dimension": {
              "name": "EmployeeID_Hierarchy",
              "qualifyingPath": "Employee"
            },
            "values": {
              "included": "${{EmployeeID}}"
            }
          }
        }
      ]
    ```

3. **Load history for analytic objects**: The application uses the Data Query API to fetch all changes by filtering by the selected attributes.

4. **Save history in database**: The application saves the fetched data in a database.

## Usage

The application's configuration is stored in two files:

`.env.visier-auth`: This file contains the authentication parameters for the Visier. 

`.env.query-changes`: This file contains parameters specific to the query changes script

Command-line arguments include:

- `-l` or `--list_data_versions`: List available data versions for export in the tenant. If passed, the application will
  list available data versions and exit.
- `-b` or `--base_data_version`: The baseline data version number to use to generate a delta export.
- `-d` or `--data_version`: The data version number the script should export.
- `-e` or `--export_uuid`: An optional UUID of the data version export to download files from. If provided, a DV export job isn't scheduled. You can find `export_uuid` in logs after first run a DV export job.
- `-m` or `--mode`: Specifies the query mode. Use `restate` to fetch the full history, or `last` to fetch only the most recent change for data version."
- `-q` or `--query`: An argument that specifies the location of your query files. The query can be a path to a directory or to a specific query.json file. If you provide a directory path, all *.json files in the directory are treated as query files and are processed individually. The application uses the queries to list changes through the Data Query API (`/v1/data/query/list`). A query must contain a filter for changes between data versions. Use the `memberSet` include filter with the `{{PropertyName}}` placeholder.
This placeholder is replaced with actual values from the DV export files. For examples, see the `queries` path. For more information about list queries, see [Data Query API Reference](https://docs.visier.com/developer/apis/data-model-query/swagger/current/index.html#/Query/Query_List:~:text=Query%20a%20list%20of%20details).

Command-line argument examples:
- `-b 7000005 -d 7000006 -m restate -q queries/employee.json`: Fetches the full history (restate) for the Employee if the EmployeeID is among the changed values between data versions `7000005` and `7000006`.
- `-e 92edafd0-22aa-11ef-9027-6fa2c7d9d5d2 -m last -q queries/productivity.json`: Fetch the last changes for the `Productivity` analytic object if the `EmployeeID` is among the changed values between data versions, using the existing export with the UUID `92edafd0-22aa-11ef-9027-6fa2c7d9d5d2`.
- `-e 92edafd0-22aa-11ef-9027-6fa2c7d9d5d2 -m restate -q queries`: Fetch the full history (restate) for all queries in the `queries` directory using the existing export with the UUID `92edafd0-22aa-11ef-9027-6fa2c7d9d5d2`.

## Data Samples:

Let's consider the timeline for analytic object `Employee` and the `DataVersion` as follows.

`V#`: These labels represent different versions of the Employee analytic object,
indicating changes that have occurred over time.

`DV#`: These labels represent different data versions in the Visier project.

```plaintext
Employee1:   ------V1--V2-------------------------V3------V4------->
Employee2:   ---------------------V1---V2-------------V3----------->
DataVersion: -DV1-----------DV2------------DV3-----------------DV4->
```

The same data is presented in a table format with dates:

| Date       | Employee1 | Employee2 | DataVersion |
|------------|-----------|-----------|-------------|
| 2024-01-01 |           |           |             |
| 2024-01-05 |           |           | DV1         |
| 2024-01-10 | V1        |           |             |
| 2024-01-15 | V2        |           |             |
| 2024-01-25 |           |           | DV2         |
| 2024-02-01 |           | V1        |             |
| 2024-02-05 |           | V2        |             |
| 2024-02-10 |           |           | DV3         |
| 2024-02-20 | V3        |           |             |
| 2024-03-01 |           | V3        |             |
| 2024-03-10 | V4        |           |             |
| 2024-03-25 |           |           | DV4         |

### Restate Mode Example:

The `restate` mode fetches the full history for an analytic object that has changed between two data versions.
The results will vary depending on when the application is run.

#### Example 1: Running the Application on 2024-01-26

The data at this date looks like:

```plaintext
Employee1:   ------V1--V2------->
Employee2:   ------------------->
DataVersion: -DV1-----------DV2->
```

Command: `-b DV1 -d DV2 -m restate -q queries/employee.json`
During this period, only `Employee1` has changes. The resulting table will look like:

| Date       | Employee1 |
|------------|-----------|
| 2024-01-10 | V1        |
| 2024-01-15 | V2        |

#### Example 2: Running the Application on 2024-03-26

The data at this date looks like:

```plaintext
Employee1:   ------V1--V2-------------------------V3------V4------->
Employee2:   ---------------------V1---V2-------------V3----------->
DataVersion: -DV1-----------DV2------------DV3-----------------DV4->
```

During this period, both `Employee1` and `Employee2` have changes. The resulting table will look like:

| Date       | Employee1 | Employee2 |
|------------|-----------|-----------|
| 2024-01-10 | V1        |           |
| 2024-01-15 | V2        |           |
| 2024-02-01 |           | V1        |
| 2024-02-05 |           | V2        |
| 2024-02-20 | V3        |           |
| 2024-03-01 |           | V3        |
| 2024-03-10 | V4        |           |

### Last Mode Examples:

The `last` mode fetches only the most recent change for an analytic object that has occurred between two data versions.
In this mode, data will be appended to the table without restatement.
The results will be consistent regardless of when the application is run.

#### Example 1: Running the Application with DV1 and DV2

Command: `-b DV1 -d DV2 -m last -q queries/employee.json`
During this period, only `Employee1` has changes. The application will fetch only the most recent change in this period:

| Date       | Employee1 |
|------------|-----------|
| 2024-01-15 | V2        |

#### Example 2: Running the Application with DV2 and DV3

During this period, only `Employee2` has changes. The application will fetch only the most recent change:

| Date       | Employee2 |
|------------|-----------|
| 2024-02-05 | V2        |

#### Example 3: Running the Application with DV3 and DV4

During this period, both `Employee1` and `Employee2` have changes.
The application will fetch only the most recent change for each:

| Date       | Employee1 | Employee2 |
|------------|-----------|-----------|
| 2024-03-01 |           | V3        |
| 2024-03-10 | V4        |           |
