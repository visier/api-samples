# Visier API samples
A collection of limited-scope sample applications and snippets using public Visier APIs.

## Structure
The samples are organized first by functional area, then by language, and then (optionally) by major library. For example, you can find the OAuth 2.0 three-legged authentication sample for Python using the [Visier Python Connector](https://github.com/visier/connector-python) under:
```
authentication
    oauth-code
        python
            connector
```

### Functional Areas
* [Authentication](authentication) provides samples showing the various methods by which users can authenticate against the Visier platform.
